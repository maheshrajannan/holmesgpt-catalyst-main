# HolmesGPT Durable SRE Agent

A durable SRE Agent that uses the open-source [HolmesGPT](https://holmesgpt.dev) agent, as a durable workflow on [Diagrid Catalyst](https://www.diagrid.io/catalyst).  A single investigator agent is used to investigate a set of sample failing apps and HolmesGPT decides which tools to call (Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Grafana, Prometheus, GitHub, YugabyteDB, Pulsar, Bash, …). Diagrid Catalyst wraps every LLM call and tool invocation in a durable workflow activity, providing durable execution to the entire system, ensuring that when calls fail or pods go down, the investigation runs to completion without expensively retrying the LLM.

This sample is using Catalyst Cloud, where Catalyst runs as a managed service and the workflow engine and state store is hosted by Diagrid, and nothing additional is running on your Kubernetes cluster.

All application code lives in [`holmes-app/`](./holmes-app/).

## How it works

- `holmes-app/app_holmes.py` is the Chainlit handler. It instantiates a single `DaprWorkflowHolmesRunner` at startup and streams events from the workflow's event tape into the UI as Chainlit steps.
- `holmes-app/holmes_config.yaml` configures HolmesGPT's toolsets, MCP servers, and custom skill paths.
- `holmes-app/skills/` holds per-incident runbooks as `SKILL.md` files. HolmesGPT matches incoming questions to a skill by description, fetches the body via the `fetch_skill` tool, and follows the workflow it prescribes.
- Workflow state, conversation memory, and the event tape are all persisted via Catalyst managed state stores (`agent-workflow`, `agent-memory`, `agent-registry`, type `state.diagrid`) — provisioned in the Catalyst project, not in-cluster.
- LLM access goes directly through LiteLLM (env-var credentials). The `llm-provider` Catalyst conversation component is retained for non-investigation LLM flows (e.g. the planned post-investigation summary in Phase 5).

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster + `kubectl` (any cluster with outbound HTTPS to Catalyst)
- `helm ≥ 3` and `jq`
- A Diagrid Catalyst account + Diagrid CLI ([docs.diagrid.io](https://docs.diagrid.io/catalyst/)), then `diagrid login`
- An OpenAI API key (or any LiteLLM-supported provider)

The container images are prebuilt on Docker Hub — you only need Docker if you want to build your own (see [`charts/README.md`](charts/README.md)).

## Skills

Each `SKILL.md` under `holmes-app/skills/<name>/` is a procedural runbook keyed by `description` in the YAML frontmatter. HolmesGPT lists them in the system prompt and fetches the matching one when a user asks an aligned question. The format is documented [upstream in HolmesGPT](https://github.com/robusta-dev/holmesgpt/tree/master/holmes/plugins/skills). Skills ship in the image, so add one under `holmes-app/skills/<name>/`, rebuild, and `make app`:

| Skill | Triggers on |
| --- | --- |
| `api-gateway-latency-spike` | "api-gateway p99 latency", SLO breaches, HTTP 504s, upstream timeouts |
| `auth-service-crashloopbackoff` | "auth-service crashing", CrashLoopBackOff, OOMKilled, cascading 401 errors |
| `checkout-api-imagepullbackoff` | "checkout-api won't start", ImagePullBackOff, ErrImagePull, "image not found", pods stuck Pending/PodInitializing after a deploy |

No registration step — the skill is discovered by its `description`; just rebuild the image and redeploy with `make app`.

## Deploy to Kubernetes

One command brings up the whole demo. Each namespace stands in for a **cluster
boundary** — `holmes` is the agent side; `yugabyte` / `pulsar` / `monitoring` /
`argocd` / `production` are the workload side Holmes investigates. The workflow
engine and state stores are managed by **Diagrid Catalyst**, so nothing additional needs to be installed on the cluster.

**You need:** `kubectl` (pointed at any cluster), `helm ≥ 3`, the Diagrid CLI
(`diagrid login`), and `jq`. The container images are prebuilt on Docker Hub —
nothing to build.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...        # optional — enables the GitHub toolset

make all
```

`make all` runs, in order:

1. **`make bootstrap`** — creates the Catalyst project + `holmes-investigator` App ID and writes the `sre-agent-secrets` Secret into the `holmes` and `yugabyte` namespaces.
2. **`make infra`** — installs ArgoCD, Prometheus/Grafana, and YugabyteDB (upstream charts).
3. **`make yb` / `make pulsar`** — `yugabytedb-mcp` and Pulsar + `snmcp`, each next to the data it fronts.
4. **`make app`** — the investigator + `github-mcp`.
5. **`make targets` / `make dashboards`** — the apps Holmes investigates + Grafana dashboards.
6. **`make argocd-token`** — mints the ArgoCD API token and restarts the app.

Then open it:

```bash
make url    # kubectl port-forward -n holmes svc/holmes-investigator 8000:8000  → http://localhost:8000
```

### Upgrade one piece (without redeploying everything)

Each component is its own Helm release:

```bash
make app                          # just the investigator + github-mcp
make yb                           # just yugabytedb-mcp + seed
make pulsar                       # just Pulsar + snmcp
helm rollback holmes-app 1 -n holmes
```

### Per-cluster settings

Override as `make` variables (or edit the Makefile defaults):

```bash
make all CATALYST_GRPC=… CATALYST_HTTP=… DNS_LABEL=my-holmes \
         IMAGE_REPO=docker.io/you/holmes-investigator
```

`make help` lists every target. Chart layout, MCP placement, swapping clusters,
and building your own images are documented in [`charts/README.md`](charts/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

- **The app hangs at startup / `durabletask-worker` can't connect.** It can't reach Catalyst. Check `DAPR_GRPC_ENDPOINT` / `DAPR_HTTP_ENDPOINT` point at your project's URLs (`diagrid appid get …`) and `DAPR_API_TOKEN` is the App ID's `diagrid://…` token. The managed components must be `ready` (`diagrid component list`), which requires the App ID to exist (run `make bootstrap`).
- **Chainlit reports `Too many packets in payload` on UI open.** Stale Socket.IO session — hard-refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R), or open in a private window.
- **`fetch_skill` succeeds but `bash` calls hit "Command requires approval".** The command isn't on HolmesGPT's bash allowlist. Add it under `toolsets.bash.config.allow` in `holmes-app/holmes_config.yaml`. The repo already allows the common read-only `argocd app *` commands.
- **HolmesGPT decides nothing matches an incident.** Check that the SKILL.md's `description:` frontmatter explicitly mentions the symptom terms your users will use ("p99 latency spike", "CrashLoopBackOff"). The description is the only signal it has for matching.
- **`argocd/core` toolset fails with `too many colons in address`.** `ARGOCD_SERVER` (a `holmes-app` value, default set by `make app`) has an `https://` scheme prefix. It must be `host:port` only — the argocd CLI prepends its own scheme.
- **`argocd/core` toolset fails with `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`.** In-cluster ArgoCD uses a self-signed cert; the chart sets `ARGOCD_OPTS="--grpc-web --insecure"` (`toolsets.argocd.opts`) to handle it.
- **Pulsar pod crashloops with `BookKeeper death watcher`-triggered shutdowns.** The latest Pulsar image (4.x) is unstable under tight I/O — the `holmes-pulsar` chart pins `apachepulsar/pulsar:3.3.7` (`pulsarImage`).
- **YugabyteDB writes rejected with "insufficient disk space".** YugabyteDB's disk-full guard rejects writes when free space is under ~1GiB, so a 1Gi PVC never works — the chart provisions 10Gi (`deploy/values/yugabyte.yaml`).
- **YugabyteDB `summarize_database` returns no info.** The seed (run by `make yb`) creates the demo tables — if it didn't complete, the `yugabyte` database is empty. If you point `YUGABYTEDB_URL` at a different database, re-apply `GRANT SELECT` for `holmes_ro` there (schema-level grants don't cross databases).
- **GitHub MCP rejects calls with `parameter X is not of type string, is <nil>`.** The github-mcp-server's parameter validation rejects null values for optional string fields, and the LLM (even `gpt-4o`) tends to serialize optional params as `null` defaults. `app_holmes.py` ships a `SYSTEM_PROMPT_ADDITIONS` block nudging the LLM to omit unset optional params — this **partially mitigates** the problem but doesn't fully solve it. The real fix is upstream (either HolmesGPT scrubbing nulls before MCP forwarding, or the MCP server accepting nulls).
